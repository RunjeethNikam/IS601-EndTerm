# Our Business Persona

- Our brand would embody the 'Explorer' archetype to depict the true French bakery experience. The goal is to take the customer to the trip to France with the help of famous food items.



# Target customers:

- Our brand would target customers with explorer type archetype who would want to experience the true french bakery taste without ever visiting France.

- We would also target customers who are willing to pay a premium price for the Authentic french food experience. the goal is to convince the customer they don't have to spend thousands of dollars to visit france, when they can pay a nominal price (compared to actually visiting France) to visit France through the their taste buds.

- out Traget customers would also include the european tourists and people who have visited france and would want to taste the same Authentic breads again.
